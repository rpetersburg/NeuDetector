	\section downloading Downloading Software

	This software is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. 
	The URL for the repository is: https://github.com/kwierman/NeuFlux .

	Pulling from the repository can be accomplished by downloading <a href="https://github.com/">Git</a>
	
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	git clone https://github.com/kwierman/NeuFlux.git
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	It is advisable that if the software is being worked on to create a separate branch. 
	This can be accomplished with the following line:

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Pushing to the repository can be accomplished with the following command:

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	git push -u origin <your_branch_name>
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	\section dep Dependencies

	The following libraries must be built and in the paths in order to build properly:

	-  ROOT
		-  <a href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/">ROOT Website</a> 
		- Required for file input and output
	-  Geant4
		- <a href="http://geant4.cern.ch/">Geant4 Website</a>
		- Required for the simulation libraries
		- Requires use of the following libraries:
			- G4EMLOW6.32
			- G4PII1.3
			- RadioactiveDecay3.6
			- G4NDL4.2
			- G4SAIDDATA1.1
			- RealSurface1.0
			- G4NEUTRONXS1.2
			- PhotonEvaporation2.3
		- It is advised to use CMake to build Geant4 as the CMake generated project files will make finding Geant4 easier when building NeuFlux
	-  CMake
		- <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake Website</a>
		- Required for building the program

	\section building Building

	In order to generate build files for the program, issue the following command:

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	cmake <directory where code resides>
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Or, to use the graphical editor:

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	ccmake <directorys where the code resides>
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	If configuring cmake and generating build files 

	\subsection nix_build Unix-Like Systems

	This includes MacOSX (Darwin).
	The commands to issue at this point are:

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	make
	make install
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Make sure to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or, on Darwin, `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the location of the libraries

	\subsection windows_build Windows

	Open the build solution in windows by either clicking on `NeuFlux.vcproj`, or opening 'Visual Studio' and open the solution 'NeuFlux'.

	Once Visual Studio has ompleted parsing the documents, navigate `Solution->Build->Release` or hit the green arrow.

	---
	\section running Running

	In order to run the program, make sure that the environmental variable, `$PATH` is set to the directory where the execution binary resides, and run

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	NeuFlux <optional path to macro>
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	The source code for the main executable is found at NeuFlux.cc
